## Changelog

**Scanner implemented**: Jan 13

 - Add `-std=gnu++11` flag to Makefile for better code
 - `next_token()` only fetches another token when `peek_token_available` is
   false, storing the token in `peek_token` and setting
   `peek_token_available` to true.
 - `eat_token()` sets `peek_token_available` to false.
 - `next_token()` fetches another token by reading a character from stdin
   and comparing. For numbers, it reads characters from stdin until too large
   (calling `scan_error()`) or it finds a non-digit, and calling
   `cin.unget()`.
 - `get_line()` returns the member `line_no` which is incremented every time
   a new line character is found.

Updated main function per email from baki: Jan 13

**Grammar modification**: Jan 21

 - Add more test cases and write a test case generator
 - Make the YACC grammar handle precedence by adding a `Term` non-terminal
 - Make the YACC grammar unambiguous by recursing only on one side
 - Make the YACC grammar an LL(1) grammar by removing left-recursion and
   left-factoring
